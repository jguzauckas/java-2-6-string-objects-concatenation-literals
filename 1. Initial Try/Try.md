# Initial Try

On lines 3 and 4, fix them so that a `String` object is properly created and saved to a variable.

On line 5, fix the print statement so that it properly concatenates the two variables.

On line 6, update the constructor to store your name and age.

On line 7, fix the print statement to correctly call information from the person object with methods.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
