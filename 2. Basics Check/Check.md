# Basics Check

Make a person with the name Mike and age 16. Using methods and `String` tools, do the following:

- Change their name to Michael
- Change their age to 17
- Save the number 10 to a variable
- Print out the sentence "Michael will be 27 in 10 years" without hardcoding the name or numbers
