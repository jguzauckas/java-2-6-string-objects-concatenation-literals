# Understanding Check

This will use the `Student` class defined in `Student.java`, so start by reading through that file.

Create yourself as a student. Using our methods, do the following:

- Print out the statement "First Last has ID # and is in grade #." without hardcoding any of the values
- Have yourself pass the year.
- Print out the statement "First is now in grade #." without hardcoding any of the values.

Create your friend as a student (make up an ID number for them that's different from yours). Using our methods, do the following:

- Print out the statement "First Last has ID # and is in grade #." without hardcoding any of the values
- Have your friend pass the year.
- Print out the statement "First is now in grade #." without hardcoding any of the values.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
